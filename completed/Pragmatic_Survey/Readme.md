### A study on differences in pragmatic perception of offensive situations

The hypotesis of the research was that in different cultures the offensivenes of some situations are perceived as significantly different, although the cultures we are considering here (native English speakers and native Italian speakers) are both Occidental.

We gained data through social media, using this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScw7Cb3C_Whp3UvcieU3pjLuaorGZKg5L-k-v5TTX2sOoCzcA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## Results

We were able to set up a Logistic Model that could predict nationality with more than 60% of accuracy, based on all 8 questions.

Analysing the questions we found out that only 4 of them were significantly different in the 2 groups.

We created a presentation (in Italian) that is named *presentation.pdf*
